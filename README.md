Repo for some of my tools created to help my Poker game. 
BrosHH is a project to create Hand History software for emulated apps that do 
not curently have good hand history software. 
OmahaEquityCalculations is software implementing the rules of Omaha to simulate 
thousands of hands to get realistic equities to help learn the game in a quiz format. 
Simulations is a few basic programs that create quizzes to help reinforce a range 
of Poker fundamentals.
